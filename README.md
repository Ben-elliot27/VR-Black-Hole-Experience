# Unity VR Black Hole Experience

Welcome to the Unity VR Black Hole Experience project repository! This project was developed as part of a university project for University College London (UCL) and showcases an immersive virtual reality game using Unity, SteamVR, and OpenXR.

## Project Overview

This Unity project creates a virtual reality journey that begins in a spaceship orbiting Earth and takes the user on a cosmic adventure through a black hole, wormhole, and ultimately into a new universe. The game is designed to visually and interactively represent complex astronomical phenomena, such as gravitational lensing and time dilation.

### Key Features

- **Spaceship Orbiting Earth**: Start the journey in a detailed spaceship orbiting Earth.
- **Interactive Thrust Lever and Launch Button**: Control the spaceship's launch towards a black hole.
- **Gravitational Lensing and Blueshift Effects**: Experience realistic visual distortions as you approach the black hole.
- **Interactive Clock**: A clock created in Autodesk Maya displays time dilation effects as you get closer to the black hole.
- **Wormhole Animation**: Traverse a visually dynamic wormhole created in Blender.
- **New Universe**: Exit through a white hole into a new universe with a distinct pink hue, signifying a different reality.
- **Return Journey**: Option to travel back to the original universe (note: functionality currently broken).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System**: The provided build is for Windows.
- **SteamVR**: Ensure SteamVR is installed and set up for your VR hardware.
- **OpenXR**: Required for VR interactions within the game.

### How to Run the Game

1. **Download the Windows Build**: Navigate to the [WindowsBuild](https://github.com/Ben-elliot27/VR-Black-Hole-Experience/tree/main/WindowsBuild) section of this repository and download all files of the latest build.
2. **Extract  Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. **Launch the Game**: Open the `.exe` file within the extracted directory to start the game.

## Project Files

In this repository, you will find:

- **Windows Build**: The executable and necessary files to run the game on a Windows system.
- **src**: All C# scripts used in the Unity project are available for review or modification.

Please note that due to Unity's large file sizes and GitHub's file size limitations, assets and some large files are not included in this repository. If you need access to these files, please contact the project maintainer.

## Known Issues

- **Return Journey Functionality**: The feature to return to the original universe via the black hole and wormhole in reverse is currently not working. This is a known issue and may be addressed in future updates.
- **User Movement on Controllers**: The user cannot move (other than walking around in the real world) using any VR controllers, they can however still move around using the wasd keys as a temporary fix until fully implemented. This can cause major issues depending on calibration and room space as the levers and buttons can be too far away to reach.

- **Interactive Clock and Controller Compatibility**: On some controllers, the clock cannot be picked up and moved, however this issue does not affect levers and buttons. Controller known to work is HTC Vive.
